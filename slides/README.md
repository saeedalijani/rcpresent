impress_ar.js
============

This is an Arabic version of [impress.js](http://github.com/bartaz/impress.js), a presentation framework based on the power of CSS3 transforms and transitions in modern browsers inspired by the idea behind [prezi.com](http://prezi.com), created by [Bartek Szopka](http://github.com/bartaz).

BROWSER SUPPORT
-----------------

Currently impress.js works fine in latest Chrome/Chromium browser, Safari 5.1 and Firefox 10.
It doesn't work in Opera, as it doesn't support CSS 3D transforms.

As a presentation tool it was not developed with mobile browsers in mind, but some tablets are good
enough to run it, so it should work quite well on iPad (iOS 5, or iOS 4 with HTML5 polyfills) and 
Blackberry Playbook.


ABOUT THE NAME
----------------

impress.js name in [courtesy of @skuzniak](http://twitter.com/skuzniak/status/143627215165333504).

It's an (un)fortunate coincidence that a Open/LibreOffice presentation tool is called Impress ;)
